Iris Dataset using Python and it's Visualization
Thesis:
•	This is a basic level iris dataset taken from Kaggle 
•	Output variable/ Dependent variable/ Target variable has 3 different classes and we need to find out from the dataset and see if we are predicting accurately.
•	I had more concentrated on the visualization part since it’s a simple logistic regression problem.
